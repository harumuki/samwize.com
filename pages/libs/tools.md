A list of tools for development.

## [twine](https://github.com/mobiata/twine)

Solves the problem of different file formats (.strings, xml, .po, etc) required by different platforms. It uses an elegate intermediatry format.

[500px](https://developers.500px.com/consolidating-string-resources-across-android-ios-468932b84ccf) forked and improved to support the plural formats too (pluralization is a nightmare)!


## [objc-dependency-visualizer](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/objc-dependency-visualizer)

Visualize your object dependencies. Supports Swift too!


## [injectionforxcode](https://github.com/johnno1962/injectionforxcode/)

Runtime Code Injection for Objective-C & Swift. Saves you time from waiting for Xcode to compile!


## Others

- objc_strings - check if any localisation unused, or not translated. Tried, but it didn't do well for iRate, whereby the code use const string
- MMLayershots - turned to PSD layers, good to use with framer.js
- Armchair - Rate App, swift, and for mac too. From Urban Apps.
- [App Stop](http://app-stop.appspot.com) - Autogen Website for your app
- https://heatmaps.io/ - but closed signup
- PaintCode - Like Sketch, but turn them into codes
