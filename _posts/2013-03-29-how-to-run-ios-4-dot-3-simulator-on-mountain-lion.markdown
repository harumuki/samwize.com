You can't.

This is a [Mountain Lion issue](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11651773/install-simulator-sdk-4-3-to-xcode-4-4-on-mountain-lion). Apple somehow broke it, and so even if you manage to download and install the simulator, you can't run it.

Apple recommend you to test on a real device.

I'm sorry.
