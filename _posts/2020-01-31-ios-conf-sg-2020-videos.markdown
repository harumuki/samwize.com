Videos from [iOS Conf SG 2020](https://2020.iosconf.sg/) are now available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUwelGOCK00mp8j241tFbeg/videos).

Here are 3 that I enjoyed.

## 1. [Global Variable Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyQ59ZfT5E0)

Admit it. **We all are using global variables**, in the form of singletons, and environment (a singleton wrapping multiple singletons)!

SwiftUI changes everything.

- View are now `Struct`
- Data are now `Class` ðŸ¤”

@twostraws showed how we can implement global data and still observe them in **UIKit**.

## 2. [Building Secure iOS Apps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6LI6j_aJ9k)

[OWASP](https://owasp.org) for mobile appsec. [MASVS](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-masvs) is a standard for mobile apps. All developers should at least implement a basic level.

Did you know can use [`LAContext` with keychain](https://github.com/OWASP/owasp-mstg/blob/master/Document/0x06d-Testing-Data-Storage.md)?

## 3. [Full stack development with Vapor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpWOD3JpSrI)

I think 2020 is prime time to use Vapor for server side development.

It's now [Vapor 4](https://theswiftdev.com/2019/08/26/whats-new-in-vapor-4/), Swift 5.1, SwiftNIO 2. The ecosystem is more mature. And a [competitor](https://medium.com/better-programming/who-killed-kitura-e5aa1096a4c1) is killed.
