I am an iPhone developer since 2008, and I am grateful for the mobile revolution that they started.

But now, I find Apple _guilty_.

**Apple stifles innovation.** Even if they're not a monopoly, they are definitely a bully. (Do watch the [congress hearing](https://youtu.be/H6eYLCxxQdA).)

Tim Cook said:

> We apply all rules to all developers equally.

_Equality my ass._

[Netflix](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-29/apple-considered-taking-40-cut-from-subscriptions-emails-show) has a **special deal** where they pay only 15%, while other developers pay 30%. Other _"reader apps"_ also had special treatment.

Or if you can [kick up a fuss](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/interview-apples-schiller-says-position-on-hey-app-is-unchanged-and-no-rules-changes-are-imminent/), some SVP will do something for you.

The treatments are [never consistent](https://youdownloadtheappanditdoesntwork.com), partly because the **rules are always changing**, and app reviewers varied in their line of work.

I have [no](/2020/04/19/taking-down-concert-camera/) [shortage](/2019/09/20/i-am-no-longer-surprise-over-app-store-review-rejections/) of app review rejections, and the latest came 2 days ago, and it again show how inconsistent the rules are.

[SG Radio](https://just2us.com/sgradio/) is an Internet radio app that I have launched 10 years ago. Surprisingly, they (or this app reviewer) now deem streaming radio stations as IP infringement and asked for authorization documents.

I am worried about my livelihood, which is _solely_ on Apple platform.

Today, I am seriously considering other open platforms.

As [Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/2020/07/parsing_cooks_opening_statement) puts it:

> To omit the fact that there was — dating back to the mid-’90s, well over a decade before the iPhone App Store — a thriving market for software sold (and downloaded) directly over a thing called “The Internet” is sophistry.
