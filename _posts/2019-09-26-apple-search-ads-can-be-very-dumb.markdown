title: "Apple Search Ads Can Be Very Dumb"

After launching [Dualgram](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/dualgram), I give [Apple Search Ads](https://searchads.apple.com/) a try.

I like their basic campaign, because it is a pay-per-install, and it is super easy to set up.

But is it any good?

## Very high cost

After running for 3 days, the result is very poor, because the Cost-Per-Install (CPI) is very high. For a free app, this will be very hard to ROI.

I ramp up my CPI slowly, reaching an average of $0.50 per install. _Only 16 installs_, after 3 days.

## Who are seeing the ads?

Basic campaign is based on Apple's **intelligent automation**, as [quoted](https://searchads.apple.com/basic/help/overview/).

You can't specify any keywords or audience etc. You just tell Apple how much you willing to pay.

How intelligent is the algorithm?

I gave it a test and search my own app name.

**Only one search result, yet they still show the Ad!**

_This is dumb._

_This is equivalent to Apple stealing my money._

I took great effort to come up with unique app name so that users can easily find it. In such case, I cannot forgive Apple for charging me.

## Advanced campaign has no device targeting

So I give their advanced campaign a try, taking things into my own hands, by specifying keywords and target audiences.

[Dualgram](https://dualgram.com) is an iOS-13-only app, and the multicam feature is available only to **iPhone XR or better**.

Apple Search Ads disappoints me, because I cannot select the device models.

For my app, it is critical to select the exact iPhone models, if not this is what you see:

Curious users will go ahead and tap to install, not knowing I am _paying for per tap_, even if you cannot install..

## To be fair

Other ad networks ain't better when it comes to device targeting.

Facebook "latest model" is iPhone XS Max. Google "latest model" is iPhone X..
