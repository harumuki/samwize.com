## The Debate 

Foo says: _We should build XXX ourselves, so that we have control and can easily maintain it._

Bar says: _We should pay YYY to get started quickly, thus providing us all the advanced features which we could take months to develop._

Many times, I come across arguments of building XXX vs paying YYY:

- Build a push notifcation system vs using [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com)/etc
- Manage your own service vs [AWS managed services](https://aws.amazon.com)/etc
- Develop email client VS [Mailchimp](http://mailchimp.com)/etc
- Host your own server hardware VS Google Compute/etc


## Both are Right

Their reasons are facts.

There is nothing to counter argue on such factual reasons.

Yet, I often hear counter arguments that starts off by disagreeing.

There could be [ego](http://just2me.com/2016/10/09/ego-is-the-enemy/) at play. Or someone doesn't know [how to win](http://just2me.com/2015/05/24/how-to-win-friends/) an argument.


## The Fair Middleground

We must consider the context in this order:

1. Who to use? Who to build? Who to maintain?
2. Do you have the luxury of time and resources to build?
3. Do you have the skillset to build?

The _who_ is especially important. The people determine the success of such undertaking.

Usually, if you are a startup, the answer is to use a service.

And, if you are a mature company with the resource to scale and optimize current processes, then you build your own service.

There is no right or wrong, but a matter of evaluating your current situation from a fair middleground, without ego.
