Learning how to write clean code is the higher level every professional developer should do.

[Clean code](https://cleancoders.com) by Uncle Bob, is an instructional video guiding you to writing better codes.

Here's what I learnt.


## Don't Write Comments

If you need to write comments to describe your methods or variables, then you are probably not naming them well enough.

Spend the time to name them concisely.

Spend the time to improve the design.

Comments usually are not updated along with the code. It is part of your "code" that becomes a burden. 

Reading and thinking over a comment wastes your energy. Is the comment valid? Now that I read the comment, let's read the method signature.. Comment is a waste of energy.


## Architecture

There is no clear definition of what is an architecture.

Often we quote architectures such as MVC, MVVM, VIPER, etc.. These are architecture defining how the layers (data, business, presentation, etc) work together.

But a architecture should really just look like the app it is.

How does the architecture of an accounting looks like? It shouts accounting when you look at it.
 

## Decomposition

Many design patterns, and decomposition is one of the most important.
