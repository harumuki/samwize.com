A list of tools for development.

## [twine](https://github.com/mobiata/twine)

Solves the problem of different file formats (.strings, xml, .po, etc) required by different platforms. It uses an elegate intermediatry format.

[500px](https://developers.500px.com/consolidating-string-resources-across-android-ios-468932b84ccf) forked and improved to support the plural formats too (pluralization is a nightmare)!

## [objc-dependency-visualizer](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/objc-dependency-visualizer)

Visualize your object dependencies. Supports Swift too!

## [injectionforxcode](https://github.com/johnno1962/injectionforxcode/)

Runtime Code Injection for Objective-C & Swift. Saves you time from waiting for Xcode to compile!
