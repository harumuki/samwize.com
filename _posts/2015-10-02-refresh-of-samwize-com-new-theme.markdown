This website is given a refresh!

Applied a new theme from [mediator](https://github.com/dirkfabisch/mediator) to give a more modern look (admittedly, it is Medium-lookalike).

Also [migrated](/2015/09/30/migrating-octopress-2-to-octopress-3/) from Octopress 2.0 to _Jekyll with Octopress 3.0 plugins_. I have pondered migrating from Octopress 2.0 to Jekyll for some time, because Jeykll is actually easier to understand and customize. And there are more themes ready for Jeykll.

Octopress 3.0 is also very different from 2.0, in that it is now officially a plugin to Jekyll.

Unlikely you will miss the old theme, but if you do, you can still find them at [o2.samwize.com](http://o2.samwize.com).
