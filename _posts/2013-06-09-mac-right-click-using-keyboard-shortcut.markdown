If you to be more efficient with computers, you must use the keyboard more than the mouse.

For Mac, it remains a mystery why there isn't a built-in keyboard shortcut for "right clicking". As of Jun 2013, with Mountain Lion, we still lack that.

However, there is a [workaround](http://superuser.com/questions/93937/keyboard-shortcut-to-right-click-in-mac-os-x). But it is recommended only for Mac users with a **separate numpad**. 

Luckily I chose to have a Apple Keyboard with Numeric Keypad for my new 27" iMac..

<!-- more -->

Go to:

	System Preferences > Accessibility > Mouse & Trackpad > Enable Mouse Keys

Press `Control+5` for right click.


## UPDATE ##

Shortly after trying out, I realize this 'shortcut' is not what I wanted.

Because to 'right click', you have to move your mouse to that location FIRST, then right click on. That is not cool.

What I wanted is when I am at a particular item, I can activate 'right click', for example to bring up the contextual menu in Finder. 
The trick above would be useless. And it rendered my Keypad useless; I can't enter numbers.

Therefore, the above is NOT recommended.
