This is a review of the book [Good Strategy, Bad Strategy](http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/Good-Strategybad-Strategy-Richard-Rumelt/9781846684814?a_aid=Just2me).

The first 20% of the book is still okay. But I could not read beyond that, as it is long winded, and used too many examples from US Military strategies.

Nonetheless, here's what I learnt:

### The Problem ###

Definition of Strategy - We don't really understand it. 

Confused, and "strategy" became a verbal tic. eg. IT Strategy, Low-price Strategy, ...

A word that can mean anything has lost its bite.

We need a redefintion. A real understanding of Strategy.


### Core of strategy work ###

= Discover critical factor in a situation + Design a way of coordinating and focusing actions
= Recognise Challenges + Approach to overcome them

A **leader's most important responsibility** is working on strategy. 

Mastering the shift from others defining your goals, to being the architect of the organisation purposes and objectives.


### A good strategy ###

- Selects the path, identifying the how, why and where leadership and determination are to be applied

- Say "NO" to wide variety of actions and interests

- It's as much as what an organisation does not do, as what it does

Why so much bad strategy?

Strategy involves focus, and choice; Most people have unwillness or inability to choose


### Kernel ###

A logical structure:

1) Diagnosis - Simplify and identify the critical

2) Guiding policy - Overall approach

3) Coherent actions - Steps that work together

Example (Apple by Steve Jobs in 1998):

> Challenge: Product lineup was too complicated. Too many price points and too much markup.

> Action: Cut all except 1 laptop, Cut distributors, Cut development

When PC is dominated by Microsoft, Apple Strategy is "to wait for the next big thing"

Apple eventually released the iPhone


### What I didn't read.. ###

After finished Part I, I merely browsed Part II and III..

Part II - Sources of Power - I don't read. Not necessary. Using leverage, advantage, dynamics, focus, growth, etc..

Part III - Not sure what's the conclusion
