Some 8 months ago, I had a post on [how to upload many localized screenshots to iTunes Connect](http://samwize.com/2014/05/24/how-to-upload-many-localized-screenshots-to-itunes-connect/).

The 2 tools I used was great. It saves tons of time and avoid repetitive work.

Fast forward to today, there is an even better tool - [fastlane](http://fastlane.tools) by [KrauseFx](http://krausefx.com).

A recommended tool for all iOS developers who localize their apps.
