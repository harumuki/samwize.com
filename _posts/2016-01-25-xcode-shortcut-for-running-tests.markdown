| What              | Shortcut                  |
|:------------------|:--------------------------|
| Run all the test  | ⌘ U                       |
| Run 1 test        | ctrl ⌥ ⌘ U                |
| Re-run last       | ctrl ⌥ ⌘ G                |

<br />

Note: Run 1 test will run the test that your cursor is on.

Of the 3, my favorite got to be re-run last tests `ctrl ⌥ ⌘ G`, because I re-run tests a lot while fixing things.
