More than 65% of apps are discovered through **App Store Search** (that's what Apple [says](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/search/)). ASO therefore has undisputed importance.

If you still not sure what is ASO, check out the [essence of ASO](http://www.slideshare.net/kolinko/appcodes-app-store-marketing-toolbox-11535165). And this [for iOS 10](http://www.slideshare.net/kolinko/appcodes-app-store-marketing-toolbox-11535165).

## The Science

There are many sciences to optimizing your funnel to the ultimate goal -- **increased downloads**. These are the factors:

- App icon
- App name
- Keywords
- Screenshots
- Ratings
- Reviews
- Description
- Version History
- Localization

And of these, keywords play a very important role, and it is an area most developer did not make use enough of. Sensor Tower has a series of lessons on the [keyword optimization](http://academy.sensortower.com/article/187-lesson-4-track-fin).


## [Too Many Tools](http://www.businessofapps.com/top-app-store-optimization-tools-aso-2016/)

There are many, but let's look at the top 3 tools (IMO) to evaluate for 2017:

- AppTweak
- SearchMan
- MobileAction
- Sensor Tower


## Pricing

- [AppTweak](https://www.apptweak.com/pricing)
  - Easiest to understand plans
  - $53/mth for 5 apps, 100 keywords, 10 competitors
  - $106/mth for 15 apps, 300 keywords, 30 competitors
- [SearchMan](https://searchman.com/products/)
  - $25/mth for each app
- [MobileAction](https://www.mobileaction.co/pricing)
  - The most complicated, because you have to choose which of the products and what extend you using it. And expensive.
  - Starts from $99/mth, with 100 keywords
- [Sensor Tower](https://sensortower.com/pricing/indie)
  - $79/mth for 5 apps, 50 keywords
  - $399/mth for 20 apps, 400 keywords, and keyword suggestion


## AppTweak


## SearchMan

Cons: Only for US, UK & Japan


## MobileAction

## Sensor Tower

## Bonus: Appcodes

Appcodes deserve a special mention - $14.95/mth - that's all. For unlimited apps, 200 phrases. 

But note they have limited support in countries outside US/UK/etc. Specifically, they don't provide competitor's tracking for other countries. 

They are for iOS only, and the business is run by just 1 guy!


## If all else failed

There is [paid search ads](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/search-ads/) from Apple..
