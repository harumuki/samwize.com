Kristina Thai wrote [Become a Better Engineer Through Writing](http://www.slideshare.net/KristinaThai/become-a-better-engineer-through-writing-62988419), and I felt she has made a good case on why we should all write.

To be a good developer, there are some soft skills:

- Communicates Well
- Passion for learning
- Able to teach/mentor

Quoting from [Shubhro Saha](http://www.shubhro.com/2014/12/27/software-engineers-should-write/):

> Code and essays have a lot more in common. The product is a sequence of logical statements, bundled into modular unitsâ€“ whether it be functions or paragraphs.

> Like good prose, good code is concise.

> Bad code wastes CPU cycles; bad essays waste brain cycles.

There are 3 main channels where we could write:

1. Private journal
2. Public blog
3. StackOverflow


## Why did I write this blog?

Here ([samwize.com](http://samwize.com)) is my public blog for my technical writing.

But long before I started blogging, I have already been keeping a private journal, documenting the technical challenges I faced, the new things I learnt, the "cheatsheets" I need to refer to frequently, etc.

It was until [2006](http://just2me.com/2006/12/17/first-blood/) (10 years ago!), that I begun writing on a public blog.

I started blogging on my work with J2ME development (those were the days)!

I don't have reason to write a public blog at first, but now I am glad for these reasons:

- I refer to my [own](http://samwize.com/2015/04/13/uiscrollview-content-view-constraints-autolayout/) [guides](http://samwize.com/2016/02/28/everything-about-xcode-ui-testing-snapshot/) [frequently](http://samwize.com/2015/10/27/implementing-nsfetchedresultscontroller-in-swift/)
- I have [helped](http://samwize.com/2015/11/06/guide-to-customizing-uitableview-section-header-footer/) [others](http://samwize.com/2014/03/14/how-to-use-uiscrollview-with-autolayout/)
- Others have [helped](http://samwize.com/2016/04/04/the-bug-to-do-with-uicollectionview-content-offset/) me
