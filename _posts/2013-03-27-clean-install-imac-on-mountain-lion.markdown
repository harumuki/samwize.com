I posted about how I [migrate an old Mac to a new Mac](/2013/02/14/migrating-old-mac-to-new-mac/) in a previous post.

After migration, I also wanted to do a clean install on the old Mac, and bring it to factory settings, but with the latest OS X (Mountain Lion for me).

It is very easy.

The steps:

- Restart computer and press **Command + R** while it restart to get to a menu screen

- Select **Disk Utility** > Macintosh HD (your startup volume) > Erase

- Go back to menu screen and select **Install Mac OS X**

Follow through and it will be done!
