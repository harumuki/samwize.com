Recently I was requested by my fiancee to help send bulk SMS to her students. Its an emergency relay.

I know how to send bulk SMS (using SMS API). What it needs is the list of phone numbers in csv format. But all she send me is a 'nice looking' word document with the names and phone numbers.. I could spend 10 minutes copy-and-paste the phone numbers..

But being a programmer, I added extraction of mobile phone numbers (Singapore format only) to [pyExtractor](https://github.com/samwize/pyExtractor). 

This is the tool which I wrote 1 year ago to extract emails, URLs and domain names.
