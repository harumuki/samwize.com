## App Review

[Appirater](https://github.com/arashpayan/appirater) is the pioneer to prompt user to rate/review your app after a few days of using the app.

After many years, [Armchair](https://github.com/UrbanApps/Armchair) provided the same function, but even easier, and it's in Swift!

When we are in the topic of showing prompt automatically, check out [Harpy](https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Harpy), which check the latest version of your app in the App Store, and prompt if the current version is outdated.


## Audio & Video

## Walkthrough/Tips

- [Instructions](https://github.com/ephread/Instructions) - Good, in Swift, but too much needed to setup, and arrow view not working well (not pointing to POI). Massive amount of code, which I could not understand easily. But I did [fork](https://github.com/samwize/Instructions) to solve for the status bar.
- [MPCoachMarks](https://github.com/bubudrc/MPCoachMarks) - Good, but in objc, and not full fledged. There is no arrow pointing north east! Though pointing correctly.
- [EAIntroView](https://github.com/ealeksandrov/EAIntroView) - Scroll views with intro
