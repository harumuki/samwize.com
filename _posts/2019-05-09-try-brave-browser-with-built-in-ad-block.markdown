I have been using this [new web browser](https://brave.com/sam690) and would love to share it with you.

## What is so great about Brave?

The unique features of [Brave](https://brave.com/sam690) are:

1. Block ads and trackers
2. Faster than Chrome/Safari
3. Earn cryptocurrency while you surf the Internet

I have been using it for months and I vouch the web browser is indeed awesome.

Youtube without ads ðŸ¤ 

Reading articles without inserted banners ðŸ¤“

No more irritating pop-up ad windows ðŸ¤—

## Hey, but this website has advertisements too!

Yup, I put Google Ads in all my websites. I am no saint.

But it is fair that creators get rewarded.

_Anyway, samwize.com generates US$15/mth, enough to pay a few coffee, to keep me writing in the night._

Now, I am okay if you use Brave, and block my ads.

Because when you visit my website with Brave, I get paid with their BAT cryptocurrency instead!

This is a new business model.

No ads for consumers, while creators get rewarded.

## How much did I earn from Brave?

Not much right now, since there are not many people using Brave browser. I hope to share some encouraging numbers in the future :)

Firstly, more people have to use the browser.

So please download now, with my [referral link](https://brave.com/sam690), and I help me earn $5 (worth of BAT)!
