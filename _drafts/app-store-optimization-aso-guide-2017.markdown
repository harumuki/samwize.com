More than 65% of apps are discovered through **App Store Search** (that's what Apple [says](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/search/)). ASO therefore has undisputed importance.

If you still not sure what is ASO, check out the [essence of ASO](http://www.slideshare.net/kolinko/appcodes-app-store-marketing-toolbox-11535165). And this [for iOS 10](http://www.slideshare.net/kolinko/appcodes-app-store-marketing-toolbox-11535165).

## The Science

There are many sciences to optimizing your funnel to the ultimate goal -- download the app.

- App icon
- App name
- Keywords
- Screenshots
- Ratings
- Reviews
- Description
- Version History
- Localization

And of these, keywords play a very important role, and it is an area most developer did not make use enough of.

## [Too many tools](http://www.businessofapps.com/top-app-store-optimization-tools-aso-2016/)

There are many, but let's look at the top 3 tools (IMO) to evaluate for 2017:

- AppTweak
- SearchMan
- MobileAction

## Pricing

- [AppTweak](https://www.apptweak.com/pricing) 
  - Easiest to understand plans
  - $49/mth for 5 apps, 100 keywords, 10 competitors
  - $99/mth for 15-300-30
- [SearchMan](https://searchman.com/products/)
  - $25/mth for each app
- [MobileAction](https://www.mobileaction.co/pricing)
  - The most complicated, because you have to choose which of the products and what extend you using it. And expensive.
  - Starts from $99/mth, with 100 keywords

## Bonus: Appcodes

Appcodes deserve a special mention - $14.95/mth - that's all. For unlimited apps, 200 phrases. 

But note they have limited support in countries outside US/UK/etc. Specifically, they don't provide competitor's tracking for other countries. 

And they are for iOS only. Pretty focus in what they do :)


## If all else failed

There is [paid search ads](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/search-ads/) from Apple..
