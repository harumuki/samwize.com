## Keyboard & Text Fields

[IQManagerKeyboard](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager) prevents keyboard from obscuring the text field, by automatically adjusting the views upwards.


## Animations

[MengTo/Spring](https://github.com/MengTo/Spring) simplify how you write animation code. You may even specify the animation properties in storyboard, without writing any code!

Before Spring, there is [Pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop), a popular animation engine written by Facebook, used in (the now defunct) Facebook Paper app. 


## Message/Notification View

Show [Toast](https://github.com/scalessec/Toast) - your message encapsulated in a small popup - for a short duration. Toast is a native UI element from [Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts.html).

[TSMessages](https://github.com/KrauseFx/TSMessages) by the fastlane guy, is a notification at the top, similar to Tweetboot.
