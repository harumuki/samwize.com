I came across this great slideshow about projects, teams and developers.

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="4f5ba2cfe593e10022020dbb" data-ratio="1.3333333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

Some of the ideas are similar to [The Lean Startup](/2012/10/11/the-lean-startup/).

Other key takeaways for me are:

<!-- more -->

## Consensus & Feedback ##

- Healthy agile teams **run on consensus**

- Consensus doesn't scale. More people = More connections. O(n^2) Problem.

- Consensus corrects for the team's needs

- Feedback corrects for the user's needs

- Consensus & Feedback => **Competes for the same resources!**


## A Great Developer ##

- Empathetic = Defend users by adpoting their perspective

- Analytical = Break down large problems

- Visionary = Identify great ideas and simplify

- Scientific = Methodically attacks problems

- Creative = Dreams up new ideas

- Professional = Invests in long-term value & maintainability

- Entrepreneurial = Kills failing projects

- Hungry = Relentlessly improves through learning, practicing and sharing
