Most of us have been typing on keyboard without knowing this hideous trick. Can't be blamed for how keyboard is designed.

```
"The straight quotes we know"
&ldquo;The curly quotes&rdquo;
```

The straight quotes is exactly the same for the left and right, while the curly quotes are not. The curly quotes looks like **66** and **99**.

# How to Type Curly Quotation Marks

To type curly quotes on a Mac, you have to type `Option+[` for opening, and `Option+Shift+[` for closing. 

If you want single and not double quotes, type `Option+]` and `Option+Shift+]` instead.

A keyboard trick worth knowing!
