Adobe announced they are [killing Flash](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/25/16026236/adobe-flash-end-of-support-2020) in 2020.

[7 years ago](https://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/), Steve Jobs explained why Apple and iPhone doesn't support Flash.

He was right.

## The most important reason

The sixth reason, the most important, he said:

> We know from painful experience that letting a third party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in sub-standard apps and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform. 

> If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features. 

> We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers.

> This becomes even worse if the third party is supplying a cross platform development tool. 

Flash was a cross platform development tool.

React Native is a cross platform development tool, too.

I [hate React Native](http://samwize.com/2017/01/24/why-i-hate-react-native/), and I briefly mentioned the [disadvantage of using another big dependency](http://samwize.com/2017/01/09/react-native-for-ios-swift-developer/).

These past events have once again reminded us to "bet" on good technologies, and who to trust.
