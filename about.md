My name is Junda, a Singaporean chinese, aka [samwize](http://twitter.com/samwize). I gradudated from [NUS](http://www.nus.edu.sg) with a Bachelor in Computing (Comp Eng) in 2008.

Developing mobile applications has always been my hobby and love, and I am adept at writing for various mobile platforms - J2ME, Blackberry, Android, Windows Phone, and my favorite iOS.

I can also write server backend using Java and Python, on web frameworks such as Google App Engine and Django. Python remains my favorite language which I think every developer should know (it's just too useful and readable).

I maintained a couple of blogs for different audiences:

- [samwize](http://samwize.just2us.com) - Development articles
- [Just2us](http://blog.just2us.com) - News for my apps
- [Just2me](http://just2me.com) - Personal blog on my life
- [Killerapi](http://killerapi.blogspot.com) - On new APIs that's cool
