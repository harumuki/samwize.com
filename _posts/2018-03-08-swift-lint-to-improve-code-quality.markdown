[SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) helps to enforce coding style.

It is useful when working in a team as it shows warnings & errors when the code is _not up to standard_. The rules are fully customizable according to the team needs.

This guide will be on how to setup [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) for an existing project, and with Fastlane.

## Step 1. Add to Podfile

    pod 'SwiftLint'
    
Of course, do a `pod install`.    
    
## Step 2. Run script on build

    # Target > Build Phases > New Run Script Phase
    "${PODS_ROOT}/SwiftLint/swiftlint"
  
Now, when you build the project, swiftlint will run.

If you run with an existing project, very likely you will have warnings/errors. This is because the default rules are being used.

## Step 3. Customize the rules

You can find [all the rules](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/master/Rules.md) in the wiki. By default, around 70% are enabled.

You can [customize the rules](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#configuration) with a `.swiftlint.yml` file in the root folder. 

Let's explain how the configuration file works with a few examples:

```yaml
# You can disable rules that have been enabled by default
disabled_rules:
  - identifier_name 
  - force_cast

# Similarly, you can enable rules that have been disabled by default
opt_in_rules:
  - first_where

# Exclude directories that you don't want to lint
excluded:
  - Pods
  - fastlane

# Use "xcode" so that when you build, the result will be shown in Xcode
reporter: "xcode" # Available reports: xcode, json, csv, checkstyle, junit, html, emoji

# `function_body_length` by default triggers warningÂ at 40, error at 100
# You can change the values for each rule.
function_body_length:
  warning: 120
  error: 300
```

Sometimes, you want to dig into the [code for each rule](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/tree/master/Source/SwiftLintFramework/Rules) to understand how it works. 

And you can also create [custom rules](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#defining-custom-rules).
  
## Step 4. Integrate with fastlane

So far, you can already see the violations when you build in Xcode.

We integrate with Fastlane for another purpose -- to generate a HTML report.

```ruby
# Add a lane in Fastfile
desc "Run lint"
lane :lint do
  swiftlint(
    mode: :lint,
    executable: "Pods/SwiftLint/swiftlint",
    reporter: "html",
    output_file: "swiftlint-results.html",
    ignore_exit_status: true
  )
end
```

The difference with using fastlane is that the reporter is set to **html**. 

You can run `fastlane lint` manually, and open up swiftlint-results.html to see all the violations. 

## Step 5. Autocorrect

Swiftlint has magic. 

For some rules, they can automatically fix your code! You are lucky if a rule [**Supports autocorrection**](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint/blob/master/Rules.md).

```ruby
# Add another lane that run autocorrect mode
desc "Run lint autocorrect"
lane :lint_autocorrect do
  swiftlint(
    mode: :autocorrect,
    executable: "Pods/SwiftLint/swiftlint",
    config_file: ".swiftlint-autocorrect.yml"
  )
end
```

Note that we use another yaml file `.swiftlint-autocorrect.yml`. This time, we use another approach to specific the rules -- whitelisting.

```yaml
# Only work for these rules
whitelist_rules:
  - trailing_whitespace
  - trailing_newline
  - vertical_whitespace
```

Run `fastlane lint_autocorrect` and watch the magic happens.

## Step 6: Disable rules in code

_Rules are meant to be broken._

Sometimes, you knowingly break rules. 

When that happens, and you know, you can disable the rule [in code](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint#disable-rules-in-code) on a case-by-case basis.

```swift
// swiftlint:disable force_cast
// Now the rules are disabled
let noWarning = NSNumber() as! Int
// Re-enable back the rules
// swiftlint:enable force_cast

// Disable with `this` (inline), `next` (next line) or `previous`
let noWarning = NSNumber() as! Int // swiftlint:disable:this force_cast
```

## Summary: The approach for an existing project

- Use the default rules
- Build
- Fix a rule by either:
  1. Autocorrect, if possible
  2. Remove it by adding to `disabled_rules`
  3. Customize it
  4. Disable in code

When all the default rules are "fixed", go through the disabled by default rules and add to `opt_in_rules`, if deemed useful.

## Bonus: Rule trailing_whitespace

"Lines should not have trailing whitespace."

Xcode by default will have whitespace for empty lines, following the indentation. This is unecessary, a bad default, which you can change.

Enable in **Xcode Preferences > Text Editing > Including whitespace-only lines**.
