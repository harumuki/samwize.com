I started [just2us.com](http://blog.just2us.com/2009/05/just2uscom-is-here/) 3 years ago, using it as a avenue for me to share about my apps and development guides.

Over the last 3 years, I have been actively blogging at just2us.com, as there are lots to share. I have especially enjoyed writing development guides which help fellow developers, as well as being a bookmark for myself. Many times, I had googled for _**topic + just2us.com**_ to recap my memories.

I wanted to keep that going, but I was constantly bothered by a few things.

<!-- more -->

1. My Wordpress template looks out-of-date after 3 years

2. There isn't a good & free Wordpress editor for Mac

3. I wish I can write in markdown or something

And so.. I decided to make a bold move and switch to [Octopress](http://octopress.org/). It is dubbed as

> A blogging framework for hackers

It makes sense:

- 	Hacker prefers entirely static HTML, aka baked; it performs better than PHP + MySQL, and not hackable!

- 	Hacker prefers to write in markdown; it's clear like code

Switching wouldn't count as risky for me, if guys like [Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/09/12/blogging-with-octopress/) (with 900+ posts) and [Felipe Cypriano](http://felipecypriano.com/2011/09/16/why-ive-migrated-to-octopress/) could migrate successfully. 

Time will tell if it's worth.
