In 2008, I started learning iOS development when the first iPhone SDK (it was _not_ called iOS SDK in the very beginning) was released. 

It was a self-learnt journey.

There were many development guides on the Internet, and I benefited from it. It was the very reason why I now write on this blog.

This post will share the guides, and will be continuously updated.

## Installing the IDE

Download [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/index.php), the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from Apple. It's free, and is the easiest IDE to install.
