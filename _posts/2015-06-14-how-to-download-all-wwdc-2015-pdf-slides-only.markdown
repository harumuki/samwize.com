Last year, I provided the script to [download all PDFs for WWDC 2014](http://samwize.com/2014/06/06/download-all-wwdc-2014-pdf-slides-only/).

This year, for WWDC 2015, I have [forked ohoachuck's wwdc-downloader](https://github.com/samwize/wwdc-downloader) to provide an option to download only the PDFs and sample codes.

To use, [download the script](https://github.com/samwize/wwdc-downloader) and run:

    ./wwdcVideoPDFGet-curlVersion.sh -p
