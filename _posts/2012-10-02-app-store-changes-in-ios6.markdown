iOS 6 has introduced a big change to how App Store works. 

The changes [means a lot to developers](http://www.gamezebo.com/news/2012/09/25/ios-6-app-store-and-what-it-means-developers), and affects how developers would write their app descriptions, screenshots, etc.

Some of the changes are so breaking, that lightwoodgames said - [don't just put up with this!](http://www.lightwoodgames.com/blog/2012/09/everything-thats-wrong-with-the-app-store-in-ios-6/#.UGhVbaQe7UO).

You could also refer to a [simple cheatsheet](http://www.apptamin.com/ASO_Cheat_Sheet-v2.pdf).

Here's my short version of what you should take note of:

<!-- more -->

1. First screenshot is very important

2. First 3 lines of description is still very prominent

3. Fill up What's New section

4. Enter your App Support URL

5. Ask your users to 'like' on Facebook

And as always, search algorithm is forever changing. Use your keywords effectively. Use unique (and not generic) keywords. Use singular form.
