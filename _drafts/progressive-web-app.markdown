## What is a Progressive Web App

It is NOT native app.

It is like web app. You visit a URL, and it _behaves_ like an app.  

But if you continue to use it, you will be prompted to "install" it. And from then on, you can use it while offline.

More [characteristics](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2016/08/a-beginners-guide-to-progressive-web-apps/).

PWA is big buzzword.

It is not an SDK (like iOS SDK).

It is merely a collection of 

- technologies: 
  - Modern web
  - Service Worker - working offline. [samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/tree/gh-pages/service-worker).
  - Web App Manifest - A JSON describing how to run the app full screen, without URL bar
- concepts: 
  - App Shell - initial/minimal UI without content
