When my new iMac was delivered, the only unsatisfactory I had was with the faulty trackpad. It can click, but can't move the cursor at all! I sent it for servicing and got a replacement after a few days.

Anyway, this post isn't about a new iMac with a faulty trackpad.

What happened is that when I use the new and working trackpad, I realized the 4 finger swipe up/down gestures were not working (therefore I can't do Expose and Mission Control).

<!-- more -->

The fix is rather trivial:

Go to Preferences > Trackpad > More Gestures > Mission Control and change **Swipe up with four fingers** to **Swipe up with three fingers**.

Try it now and it should work.

Now, change it back to **Swipe up with four fingers**, and it works too!

Do the same trick for App Expose.

Finally, go to Point & Click to re-enable **Three Finger Drag**.
