          <p>My experience with using ads in iOS goes as far back in 2008 when iOS is released. It was simple back then, but now, I have lost count of the number of ad networks.</p>

<p>See what I mean:</p>

<p>This post I am going rave a bit. So..</p>

<p>tldr;</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use 2 mediation - <a href="http://admob.com">Admob</a> &amp; <a href="http://mopub.com">MoPub</a> - and split them 50-50</li>
  <li>Use <a href="http://admob.com">Admob</a></li>
  <li>Use <a href="http://mmedia.com/">MillenialMedia/mMedia</a></li>
  <li>Use <a href="inmobi.com">InMobi</a></li>
  <li>Use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/iad/">iAd</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="in-the-early-days">In the early days..</h2>

<p>Back in the early days (2008), there is an obvious choice - <a href="http://admob.com">Admob</a>.</p>

<p>Back then, Admob is a startup, with strength in mobile analytics and mobile advertising. In fact, I started using them for mobile analytics in 2007.</p>

<p>When iPhone boomed, so did their value as they have a strong mobile ad network. They were eventually acquired by Google in the range of $BILLION$!</p>

<h2 id="then-come-mediation---adwhirl">Then come mediation - Adwhirl</h2>

<p>I was quite comfortable just serving ads from admob. It was also the first time that I had revenue coming from ads!</p>

<p>It was good, but I soon realized it could be better in around 2009.</p>

<p>Ads mediation became popular, and <a href="https://www.adwhirl.com/">Adwhirl</a> was the popular choice, as they are free, uncluttered, and open source.</p>

<p>By using a mediation means I start to use more than 1 ad network. Read on what I used.</p>

<p>Once again, Adwhirl was eventually acquired by Google..</p>

<h2 id="more-ad-networks">More ad networks</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/">Google Adsense</a> was the main reason that I used a mediation. In 2009, Google was a newcomer to mobile advertising, with Admob dominating.</p>

<p>However, we all know Google has the resource to catch, plus it has good network on the web advertising. I applied to be the BETA to mobile Adsense. I got in, integrated with Adwhirl, and revenue gets even better!</p>

<p>I realized mediation does help a lot. Reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When 1 ad network cannot be filled, it can try others</li>
  <li>Inventory increased, so there is more varierty of ads shown</li>
</ul>

<p>I also integrated Quattro and Greystripe, but with little success from them.</p>

<p>And also iAd, but little success as my users are mainly outside US.</p>

<h2 id="the-google-world-is-not-good">The Google world is not good</h2>

<p>I have thought with the acquisition of Admob and Adwhirl, Google will provide great stuff.</p>

<p>I was totally wrong.</p>

<p>Admob is not improving. Their website design remains the same as 5 years ago. What’s worse is that by introducing mediation and house ads, they now look complicated.</p>

<p>Adwhirl is deprecated. It’s last SDK update is in 2011. If you want to use Adwhirl, you should use Admob. But there are actually better alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="mopub---the-new-kid">MoPub - the new kid</h2>

<p>I started looking into <a href="http://mopub.com">MoPub</a> in 2012 for these reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Admob mediation is cranky. It reported fill rate as <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/google-admob-ads-sdk/wLMKhV2pMiA/tHfttXGfzlEJ">low</a> as 4% for my other networks! (serving Admob ads is very fine &gt;90%)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admob provides no support. Just like other Google service, it is hard to even find their support email. I posted on their Forum, but no Admob staff is replying.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admob SDK will crash when they serve InMobi (hence I cannot use InMobi at all)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Admob website looks like in the 1990s</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To sum up, I wanted to move away from Admob.</p>

<p>MoPub looks great, and has it’s SDK opensourced.</p>

<p>One of the problem with mediation is that integration is complex, and the network adaptors could be buggy (like the InMobi case with Admob). I thought MoPub is smart to provide their SDK source code. If there is a problem, at least we can fix it.</p>

<p>MoPub also promised integration with certain ad network without the need to integrate into the app. I have yet to try.</p>

<h2 id="the-50-50-mode">The 50-50 mode</h2>

<p>However, that said, I choose to use both Admob and MoPub as mediation.</p>

<p>When I was using MoPub, I encountered some problems too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Frequently, it has the error “server response indicated no ad available.” and doesn’t get filled!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MoPub serve in a eCPM waterfall manner. That is it get ads from the network that pays best first, if not filled, then it moves on.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Because of that, MoPub often serve the same ad. I seldom see Admob/Adsense ads. I rather have variety in my inventory.</p>

<p>To play safe, I do a 50-50 split.</p>
