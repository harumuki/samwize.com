Following the use of [dotfiles](/2014/01/12/getting-started-with-dotfiles/) to improve my productivity, I got into using Zsh.

Zsh is a much better bash.

It is a command line shell that will improve your productivity. For example, it can autocomplete common commands. If you type `git a<tab>`, it will prompt `add`, `am`, etc.. And it has community driven theme.

To get started, go to [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) on github.
