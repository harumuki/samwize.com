If you are starting out iOS development, there are some good tips for you from Stuart Hall:

There is only one point which I don't agree on:

> Story Boards Are Just For Rapid Prototypes

<!-- more -->

The choice between "Story Boards" vs "Code the UI" depends very much on your app requirements. 

For simple apps that use the stock UI components, Story Board is really useful because

1. Drag and drop to design = very quick and easy to make UI changes

2. Support Auto Layout easily = Design iPad and iPhone at the same time easily

3. Xcode support = Beautiful UI is possible with powerful customizable features

In each version of iOS, Apple has made Story Board (XIB) and Xcode support much better. They kept improving. They value Story Board. 

Hence, you will be missing out a lot if you didn't even bother trying it out.
