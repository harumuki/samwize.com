It took me a few months before I decide "All My Files" is a useless feature for Mac OS Lion. 

I was irked that it is the default view when you create new Finder window. And I was even more irked that the default arrangement by Kind shows my Adium chat log right at the top..

<!-- more -->

So I decided to change it.

	Finder > Preferences > General > New Finder windows show: Downloads

	Finder > Preferences > Sidebar > Uncheck as Favorites

If I still want to access "All My Files", I could still use the handy shortcut Shift+Cmd+F.
