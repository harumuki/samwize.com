I have kept a secret from my wife. I use some shortcuts when I text her, since 10 years ago.

![gm and gn](/images/deleting-these-shortcuts.jpg)

But I am deleting the above 2 shortcuts today.

Why?

Firstly, we are happily married for 5 years and we don't text that kind of stuff anymore.

## Secondly, because of Xcode GM

When I type "Xcode GM", it expands to become **Xcode Good Morning (:**.

It is unintended. What's more, GM is now more frequently used to refer to _Gold Master_.

If you didn't yet know.. Xcode GM is now at [Seed 2](https://developer.apple.com/app-store-connect/whats-new/?id=09162019a), and for the first time in Xcode history, **a GM is not a final version**.

Maybe a Seed 3 would be coming..

So get used to seeing more GMs.

This is a random rant.
