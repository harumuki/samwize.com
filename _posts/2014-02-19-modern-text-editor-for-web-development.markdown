I _consistently struggle_ with which text editor to be my favorite.

Today, I tried [Brackets](http://brackets.io), and I think it will stand out to be best for **modern web development**.

I still use [sublime text](http://www.sublimetext.com), and also think I will buy [JetBrain WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) someday for Node.js development.

## Why Brackets

This text editor from Adobe is very amazing as a product, and as an open-source project:

- It's Live Preview of HTML/CSS on the browser is instanteneous, not even a refresh!

- The Mac app itself is built uing **HTML, CSS and Javascript**

- And you can dig into the [source code](https://github.com/adobe/brackets)

- There is a community of people on their [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/brackets/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88)

- It has [a lot of extensions](https://brackets-registry.aboutweb.com)

- For example, the popular [Emmet](http://emmet.io) extension to expand abbreviations

- Or [built your own extension](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Write-Extensions) easily
