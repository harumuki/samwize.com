## Empty State for Table/Collection

[DZNEmptyDataSet](https://github.com/dzenbot/DZNEmptyDataSet) create a view when your table/collection view is empty. You customize it with attributed strings for the title, subtitle and the call-to-action-button. If the standard layout is too enough, you may return your own view.

## Keyboard & Text Fields

[IQManagerKeyboard](https://github.com/hackiftekhar/IQKeyboardManager) prevents keyboard from obscuring the text field, by automatically adjusting the views upwards.

## Animations

[MengTo/Spring](https://github.com/MengTo/Spring) simplify how you write animation code. You may even specify the animation properties in storyboard, without writing any code!

Before Spring, there is [Pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop), a popular animation engine written by Facebook, used in (the now defunct) Facebook Paper app. 

## Message/Notification View

Show [Toast](https://github.com/scalessec/Toast) - your message encapsulated in a small popup - for a short duration. Toast is a native UI element from [Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/toasts.html).

[TSMessages](https://github.com/KrauseFx/TSMessages) by the fastlane guy, is a notification at the top, similar to Tweetboot.

## Custom Modal Popup

[Presentr](https://github.com/IcaliaLabs/Presentr) wraps around the iOS 8 custom view controller presentation API for you to easily present popup view.
