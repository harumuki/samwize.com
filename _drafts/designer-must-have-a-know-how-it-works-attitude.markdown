I have worked with many product designers and one trait that separate the best from the crowd is the attitude to know how things work, from a technical level.

This could be bias, as I speak from a technical point of view.

## I am a developer, with many hats

This are opinions coming from a developer at heart.

But I am also a developer who many hats. Often, I put on my product designer and business hat. So in a way I am T-shaped.

Developers should agree with my sentiments.


## Designers with a lack of technical knowledge

We used to have product designers who came from a development/technical background.

But over the years, there is a demand in "designers", and people from all sorts of discipline took up the role.


## You must know how it works

Many proudct designers create their designs without knowing how things work.

They design without considering how the data can come from.

Let me use an example.

The design for this search pre-populates with the most popular movies.

The intention is good. Users may find what they are going to search for in the list.

However, taken things into context, it is not good.

Firstly, this is an initial version, and we want a MVP.

Secondly, we have tight resource, and this is one that can be dropped.

Thirdly, and mostly important, it wasn't thought through on what is popular. What is the algorithm to sort the popularity? Is there an endpoint for that?
