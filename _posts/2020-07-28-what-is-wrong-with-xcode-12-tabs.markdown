In new Xcode 12, there is a "new" tab system. There is a tabs within tabs. Something along _window tab_ or _document tab_.

I cannot figure out what's the point, except it frustrates me with how I navigate to previous/next tab using CMD+SHIFT+[ or ].

And they haven't fix in Beta 3.. so I switch back to the original tabs I know.
